### Applications
- [MapAnalyst](https://mapanalyst.org/) - MapAnalyst is a software application for the accuracy analysis of old maps. Its main purpose is to compute distortion grids and other types of visualizations that illustrate the geometrical accuracy and distortion of old maps.

### QGIS Extensions
- [Historical Maps Vectorization Tools](https://github.com/EVS-GIS/hmvt-cli) - A toolbox to vectorize fluvial corridor objects on historical maps. [More about this tool here.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220144108_Visualizing_the_Planimetric_Accuracy_Of_Historical_Maps_With_MapAnalyst)
