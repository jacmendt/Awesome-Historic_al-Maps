## Databases and Search Engines

About this section. Optional. Keep this short and focus on the list.

### Search Engines
- [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/) - DESCRIPTION.
- [National Library of Scotland's Map Finder](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/#zoom=7.0&lat=57.00000&lon=-4.40000&layers=102&b=1&z=0&point=0,0)

### Databases
- [Open Historical Map](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/)
- [World Historical Gazetteer](https://whgazetteer.org/) - World Historical Gazetteer (WHG) is providing a collection of content and services that permit world historians, their students, and the general public to do spatial and temporal reasoning and visualization in a data rich environment at global and trans-regional scales.

- [Archive.org - Images: Maps](https://archive.org/details/image?&and[]=subject%3A%22Map%22) - The Internet Archives has an extensive collection of maps. Make sure to search here.
- [The National Archives Map Collection (UK)](https://images.nationalarchives.gov.uk/assetbank-nationalarchives/action/browseItems?categoryId=23&categoryTypeId=1) - Maps and plans from 1485 to the early 1900s are covered in this collection, with a concentration around the 18th and 19th centuries. These include maps of America, Canada and the West Indies, plus military and political Foreign Office maps. There is also a collection of colourful maps of early England and Ireland.
- [University of Oxford: Bodleian Map Room](https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/maps) - [Card Catalogue (Depreciated)](http://canvas1.bodleian.ox.ac.uk:5000/mmap/map-index.php)- The Bodleian holds nearly two million maps and around 20,000 atlases, including material dating from the 14th to the 21st century. The collection is international and includes maps from all over the world, although it is strongest in British material and maps from countries with a historical connection with the UK. There are early printed maps, town plans, manuscript estate maps, topographical series, scientific and geological mapping, sea charts, air charts and maps of the stars. These collections include:
  - [Digital Bodleian](https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/): Almost 2,500 maps and atlases are available on Digital Bodleian, with more to come soon.  
  - Portolan charts: Portolan charts are manuscript maps of coastal areas intended for maritime navigation. They are derived from mariners' observations of compass bearings and estimated distances between given points on the Earth -- typically ports. The term 'portolan' originates from the Italian 'portolano,' meaning 'related to ports or harbours.' During the Age of Exploration, portolan charts were closely guarded secrets, especially among the main European naval powers. The Bodleian Libraries' collection comprises 22 individual portolan charts and another 10 portolan atlases. These span the period from the 15th century to 1741, including work by Dutch, English, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish mapmakers.
  - The Todhunter Allen Collection: The Todhunter Allen Collection of maps and county atlases dating from 1573 to 1900 acts as a microcosm of three centuries of British cartography. It was put together early in the twentieth century by Hugh Todhunter, and later George Allen, and came to the Library in 1987. The listing phase of the project was completed in 1997, and the online cataloguing onto [SOLO](https://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo-explore/search?vid=SOLO&lang=en_US&sortby=rank) finished in June 1999, increasing access to the collection, which contains several rare or unique editions of atlases.
  - WWI trench maps: The Bodleian Libraries have approximately 2,500 maps of the Western Front, at scales of 1:10,000, 1:40,000, and 1:80,000. The GSGS published several editions of these maps throughout the war, although most are from late 1915 onwards. The series include both standard and 'secret' versions -- the secret maps showed British trench systems in addition to German ones. These sheets were individually numbered and it was forbidden to take them close to the front lines in case of capture. The 1:10,000 series indicate individual trenches and their names or numbers.
  - Other map collections in the Bodleian: The Commonwealth and African Aerial Photograph Archive holds a part copy of the Ordnance Survey International Collection. This comprises approximately 1.5 million aerial photographs of countries in Eastern, Southern, and Western Africa, as well as parts of Asia and the Americas. These images were taken by the Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) mainly in the 1940s-1970s, to enable them to produce maps at ground scales of 1:30,000 to 1:50,000. Enquiries about this collection should be directed to the [archivist](lucy.mccann@bodleian.ox.ac.uk). 
- [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/) - The David Rumsey Map Collection was started over 35 years ago and contains more than 150,000 maps. The collection focuses on rare 16th through 21st century maps of North and South America, as well as maps of the World, Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. The collection includes atlases, globes, wall maps, school geographies, pocket maps, books of exploration, maritime charts, and a variety of cartographic materials including pocket, wall, children's, and manuscript maps. Items range in date from around 1550 to the present.
- [r/oldmaps (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/oldmaps/) - User uploaded collection of interesting maps.

#### Maritime
- [Sea Atlases from the Harvard Map Collection](http://sea-atlases.org/) - Beginning in the late 16th century, the nascent cartographic publishing industry found a receptive market for pilot books and sea atlases, which provided collections of detailed charts and sailing directions for the most frequently traversed routes.
